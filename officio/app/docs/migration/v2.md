# Migrating Officio v1 to v2

#### Step 1. Verify folder structure changes

#### Step 2. Server software changes
##### MySQL
- Make sure MySQL runs in non-strict mode: `sql_mode` has to be set to `NO_ENGINE_SUBSTITUTION`.

#### Step 3. Configuration changes
- Officio has moved away from using Mcrypt as it is considered outdated and insecure library.  
    All the data encoded with Mcrypt will be decoded (if it wasn't hashed) and re-encoded using
    OpenSSL library. 
    Do the following changes in application/config/config.ini file:
    - `security.password_hashing_algorithm` should be set to `password_hash`
